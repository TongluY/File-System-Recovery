## Project Overview

In this project, I implemented an ext2 disk image checker to retrieve JPG files from a disk image based on specific conditions. 

### Project Objectives

1. **Conditional Retrieval**:
   - retrieve only the JPG files (including deleted ones) from top_secret directory.
   - retrieve all JPG files from the entire disk image if it's not top_secret
2. **File Generation**:
  - For each retrieved JPG file, the program will generate the necessary details and copies in the specified output directory.

This project helps me understand ext2 file systems and improve my skills in file retrieval and data recovery.
